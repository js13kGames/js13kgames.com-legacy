#Â js13kgames website

The source of the js13kgames.com website.

## Installation

1. Ensure [Node 5](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed, then go to the project folder and execute on a shell:
```
npm install
```

2. Copy the .sqlite database in the root folder of the project

3. Edit the migrations table (just once) in the .sqlite file:

```
ALTER TABLE migrations ADD COLUMN name varchar;
```

4. Install [Imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org)

## Running

After installing, run all the migrations executing:

```
./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
```

Then precompile the assets with:
```
gulp sass
```

And finally, start the app with:
```
npm start
```

Then go to http://localhost:3000 and enjoy.

## Development

To precompile your assets during development run:
```
gulp watch
```
This will process the SASS files in the source folder and write them to the public/assets folder of the site ready to
be used. Each change to the SASS file will trigger a new build.

To clean the assets:
```
gulp clean
```

## CSS Methodology

The files are pre-processed SASS files. These are not processed at run time via express for performance reasons.

The files are arranged based on recommendations - http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project and
generate a single main.css file.

The CSS is structured around [12 column grid bootstrap grid](https://getbootstrap.com/examples/grid/). Additional
styles use the BEM (block element modifier) methodology. In short this means styles are component based and do not
cascade preventing issues around importance.
See https://en.bem.info/methodology/ for more details.
